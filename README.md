A repostitory of code testing the usage of nrf24l01(+) radio modules with AVR microcontrollers. Likely will communicate with other microcontrollers using the same modules ( like MSP430, in my [msp430-nrf24l01-testing](https://github.com/emdarcher/msp430-nrf24l01-testing) repo ).

Will possibly be trying various libraries, or using parts of them.
